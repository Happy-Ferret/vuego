Vuego Framework
===============

This is a WASM-based Vue.js wrapper written in Go.
It uses the Go 1.11+ Web Assembly compiler to compile the wrapper.

The first version of Vuego aims to be a thin Vue.js wrapper which allows writing frontend in the Go programming language.

The immediate benefit of Vuego is that it allows Vue.js users to deliver their Web applications in binary (Web Assembly) forms.
So your companies would have a better way to protect IPs for Vue.js applications.
